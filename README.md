### Workshop Pre-requisites

- A GitHub.com account
- A Glitch.com account
- A repository you don't mind getting messy
- Excitement

### Useful links throughout the workshop

- Probot documentation: https://probot.github.io
- Google Translate API: https://cloud.google.com/nodejs/docs/reference/translate/2.1.x/
- Page where you can view and re-deliver webhooks: https://github.com/settings/apps/your-app-name/advanced
- Documentation for the Node.js GitHub SDK: https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/

### Workshop steps

1. Create your Glitch app by following this link: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/probot-workshop
1. Wait for Glitch to load and for it to install all the dependencies. You can see progress by clicking on "Status" in the top left corner
1. Click the "Show Live" button at the top of the page. A new tab should open and the page should have a "Register GitHub App" button
1. Click the "Register GitHub App" button and choose a name for your GitHub App. A GitHub app will be created for you in the background. Once it is complete you will see a new page that asks you where you want to install your new app.
1. On this page, select the "Only select repositories" and in the dropdown choose the your sandbox repository. If you don't have one, that's fine - just create a new blank repo.
1. Then head back to Glitch, it's time to write some code!

### Extend and improve your app further

- Add multiple language translations to each comment
- Properly translate text with code blocks and markdown
- Also translate the opening comments of new issues and pull requests
- Add configuration options with [`context.config()`](https://probot.github.io/api/latest/classes/context.html#config)
